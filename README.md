# Principal-Component-Analysis-on-Churn-Data

INTRODUCTION

In this task, you will act as an analyst and create a data mining report. In doing so, you must select one of the data dictionary and data set files to use for your report from the following link: Data Sets and Associated Data Dictionaries.

You should also refer to the data dictionary file for your chosen dataset from the provided link. You will use Python or R to analyze the given data and create a data mining report in a word processor (e.g., Microsoft Word). Throughout the submission, you must visually represent each step of your work and the findings of your data analysis.

SCENARIO

One of the most critical factors in customer relationship management that directly affects a companyâ€™s long- term profitability is understanding its customers. When a company can better understand its customer characteristics, it is better able to target products and marketing campaigns for customers, resulting in better profits for the company in the long term.

You are an analyst for a telecommunications company that wants to better understand the characteristics of its customers. You have been asked to use principal component analysis (PCA) to analyze customer data to identify the principal variables of your customers, ultimately allowing better business and strategic decision- making.

Part I: Research Question

A. Describe the purpose of this data mining report by doing the following:
1. Propose one question relevant to a real-world organizational situation that you will answer by using
principal component analysis (PCA).
2. Define one goal of the data analysis. Ensure that your goal is reasonable within the scope of the
scenario and is represented in the available data.

Part II: Method Justification

B. Explain the reasons for using PCA by doing the following:
1. Explain how PCA analyzes the selected data set. Include expected outcomes. 
2. Summarize one assumption of PCA.

Part III: Data Preparation

C. Perform data preparation for the chosen dataset by doing the following:
1. Identify the continuous dataset variables that you will need in order to answer the PCA question
proposed in part A1.
2. Standardize the continuous dataset variables identified in part C1. Include a copy of the cleaned
dataset.

Part IV: Analysis

D. Perform PCA by doing the following:
1. Determine the matrix of all the principal components.
2. Identify the total number of principal components using the elbow rule or the Kaiser criterion. Include
a screenshot of the scree plot.
3. Identify the variance of each of the principal components identified in part D2.
4. Identify the total variance captured by the principal components identified in part D2.
5. Summarize the results of your data analysis.
